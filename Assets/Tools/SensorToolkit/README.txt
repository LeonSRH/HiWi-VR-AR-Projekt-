1.2.0
- Sensors can now be configured with tag filters.
- Added 'GetVisibleTransforms' and 'GetVisiblePositions' methods to trigger/range sensors, to query the raycast targets on a detected object that are in line of sight.
- range/trigger sensors can be configured to only detect objects with LOSTargets components.
- Added new PlayMaker actions.

1.2.1
- Fixed SensorGetVisibleRaycastTargets playmaker action so that visible Transforms are returned correctly.
- Removed duplicate TagSelectorPropertyDrawer.cs editor file which was causing builds to fail.
